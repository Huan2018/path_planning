# path_planning
The various path planning algorithm.<br>
DijkstraGrid.m - This file contains the skeleton code for the Dijkstra planner. It is expected to return the route(path) found, along with the number of nodes expanded by the planner.<br>
AstarGrid.m - Similarly this file contains the skeletal implementation of the A* planner. This function is also expected to return the route(path found) and the number of nodes expanded.<br>
TestScript1.m - This file invokes the DijkstraGrid.m and AstarGrid.m with some start and goal coordinates. Use this script to test your planners with different configurations of the environment. This file also contains the `map' variable that defines the environment and the obstacles in it. Vary the environments and pose challenging path-planning problems for your planners.<br>
