# path_planning
The various path planning algorithm.<br>
**triangle intersection.m** - The function used to check if the given triangles overlap.<br>
**DijkstraTorus.m** - The function to find the shortest path through a given input map using Dijkstra's algorithm.<br>
**CollisionCheck.m** - The function to determine if two sets of triangular faces overlap.<br>
**TwoLinkRobot.m** - The function to compute the layout of the robot based on the joint angles, theta1 and theta2.<br>
**TwoLinkCSpace.m** - The script used to run the simulation.<br>
**appendFV.m, transformFV.m** - Helper functions for constructing the simulation environment.<br>
